                The relationship between happiness metrics and societal indicators presents a complex and controversial topic in data visualization. The controversy stems from how averaged global data can potentially mask significant country-level variations and disparities in well-being measures. <br/>
                <p></p>
                The visualization shows seemingly contradictory trends - while GDP per capita and healthy life expectancy show general improvements from 2015-2019, government corruption remains persistently high and freedom of choice shows minimal progress. This creates tension between positive economic indicators and stagnating social metrics, making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions about global progress. The use of averaged data across countries further complicates interpretation, as it potentially obscures important regional differences and inequalities that could tell a very different story at the local level.

                <b>1.	Information Access Rhetoric</b> <br/>
                •	Axis thresholding emphasizes relative differences by setting y-axis from 0 to 1.0. <br/>
                •	Happiness score placement at top creates visual emphasis on positive trends. <br/>
                •	Yellow highlighting bands direct attention to specific years. <br/>
                <b>2.	Mapping Rhetoric</b> <br/>
                •	Color coding differentiates positive indicators (blue, green) from negative ones (red). <br/>
                •	Visual hierarchy prioritizes GDP and health metrics through placement. <br/>
                •	The upward trends in positive metrics are made more prominent. <br/>
                <b>3.	Metonymy Through Averaging</b> <br/>
                •	Uses country-level data aggregation to represent complex global patterns. <br/>
                •	Simplifies interpretation by condensing multiple national data points into single representative values. <br/>
                •	Creates a part-whole relationship where averages represent broader global trends. <br/>

                <b>1.	Information Access Rhetoric</b> <br/>
                •	Inverted y-axis (0 at top) emphasizes growing negative impact. <br/>
                •	Area stacking creates cumulative visual effect. <br/>
                •   Happiness scores are transformed by subtracting 4 to fit within a manageable scale range, representing a thresholding technique that focuses attention on the relative changes rather than absolute values. <br/>
                •	Continuous flow suggests interconnectedness of problems. <br/>
                <b>2.	Visual Framing</b> <br/>
                •	Color gradients from light to dark convey increasing severity. <br/>
                •	Expanding total area emphasizes growing challenges. <br/>
                •	Stacked format forces simultaneous consideration of all factors. <br/>

                •	Aggregates country-specific challenges into global representative values. <br/>
                •	Simplifies complex international variations into clear trends. <br/>
                •	Uses averaged data to emphasize overall patterns while minimizing distracting variations. <br/>
